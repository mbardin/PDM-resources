Hii!

My name is Altblankn, and I just wanted to thank you for downloading this pack.

The tahitian ukulele is a great instrument, but I've always found it very difficult to record as 
the strings (just made of fishing wire) make an extremely high, delicate sound and also create 
loads of percussive noise when played too hard.

I know the tahitian ukulele isn't a very well-known insturment, which is why I wanted to 
share it with everyone, at least some basic chord progressions and melodies, which is why this pack
is free.


Regarding the loops themselves, I edited them slightly just to make sure the beats fell where they were supposed to
and I added some basic compression and also a de-esser, which I find works best with this instrument just to remove
the scratches and extremely high-end sounds

I'll be releasing a much more extensive pack in the future with individual chords and notes played seperately, 
but that one will have to be paid for I'm afraid.

For now, I hope you enjoy these loops:)
